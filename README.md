## Key Insights for Presentation

> **- We could say that with increase the distance the duration of trip increse but as i mentioned before that at 0 distance there are trip duration and that becuase the fact that may the start and end station the same but they make a trip an go back to the same start point.**

> **- males are more as subscriber and customer than Feamles.**

> **- The subscibers are more than customers in all week days but the customers number of bike trip is the same in all weekdays.**

> **- The least hours that have bike trips are from 10pm to 6am and the highest hours are 3pm to 7pm and from 7am to 9am. And the subscribers are higher for all hours. Besides,the most hours with trips are morning and afternoon but also there are some hours at night with high trips but that didn't obvious in previous plots as we said in perivious section that morninig and afternoon trips are double the night trips.**

> **- There is a symetry for median of start hour for all weekdays which is between 14 to 15 but for only friday it is 11 to 12.**

> **- The median trips duration for females is slightly higher than males despite of the number of males are higher and for afternoon period is slightly higher than other periods.**

> **- The median distance for all week days are almost the same But we can say that the median trips distance for females is slightly higher than males despite of the number of males are higher and for morning periods is slightly higher than other periods and that may because the bikers go to their work by bikes.**
